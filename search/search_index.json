Main principles to follow; API controllers are only responsible for specifying processing steps. They should not contain or depend any implementation details about database or models. Database-related operations should be abstracted from the rest of the system. That way database changing costs could be minimal. Model related data structures should be separated. With these principles in mind there will be 6 seperate projects; Project Contents References Core [Class Library] Models, Exceptions, Interfaces - Persistence [Class Library] Database-related operations for both api and external services Domain Infrastructure [Class Library] External services (like notification, stmp, logging etc.) Domain, Persistence Application [Class Library] Application logic Domain, Persistence, Infrastructure Api [Web Api Project] Controllers (get request and return response) Application Tests [Class Library] Unit tests, integration tests etc. Api Versioning Project will follow rolling release concept. Response Codes Code Use Cases 200 OK Response to a successful GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE requests. 201 Created Response to a successful POST request which results in a creation. 204 No Content Response to a successful request which doesn't have body. 304 Not Modified \u2753 Useful when HTTP caching is present. (Not yet planned.) 400 Bad Request Response to an unsuccessful request with bad data. 401 Unauthorized Response to an unsuccessful request with invalid authentication. 403 Forbidden Response to an unsuccessful request with valid authentication but with invalid authorization. 404 Not Found Response to an unsuccessful request made to unknown endpoint. 405 Method Not Allowed Response to an unsuccessful request which isn't allowed for authenticated user. 410 Gone Response to an unsuccessful request made to endpoint that no longer available. 415 Unsupported Media Type Response to an unsuccessful request with incorrect content type. 429 Too Many Requests \u2753 Useful when the request rejected due to rate limiting. (Not yet planned.) Endpoint Naming Strategy Endpoints will follow this main structure; /resource/:id/:subResource/:subResourceID For example; Resource POST GET PUT (replacing) PATCH (partial update) DELETE /users Creates new user. Returns user list. Method not allowed. (405) Method not allowed. (405) Method not allowed. (405) /books/1 Method not allowed. (405) Returns book info. Replaces book info. Updates book info. Removes book. Filtering For any filterable resource there will be filter query. For example; GET /users?is_public=true Will return only users with public profile. Paging Default page size is 30 items. (This can be changed in the implementation.) Example; GET /books?sortDescending=PrintDate&page=2 Will return 2nd latest 30 books. Detailed endpoint list can be found in Endpoints section. Authentication When the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned. Then authenticated requests should feature Authorization header using the Bearer schema; Authorization: Bearer <token> Authorization Main authorization model is role based using JWT claims until MVP. After MVP more complex authorization system should be a way to go. Database PostgreSQL 12 will be main choice until MVP. Endpoints This section will be replaced eventually by API documentation.
